You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Configuration Steps

### Configure Options

- Open the `config.ts` file located at the root of the project.
- Adjust all necessary options according to necessity.
- Select the primary font to be used throughout the application.

### Set Colors

- Open the tailwind.config.ts file.
- Define your color palette here. These colors will be applied to all components in the project.

### Set Favicon

- Place your favicon (favicon.svg) inside the /app directory at the root of the project.

### Add Open Graph Image

- Add the open-graph.jpg file inside the /public directory at the root of the project.

## Styling Components
All components in the project use variants with primary, secondary, and tertiary colors and have basic styling applied. To customize the appearance of these components according to your design specifications, you can add new styles to match the design.
